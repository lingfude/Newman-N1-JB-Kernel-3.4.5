= 3.4.5 kernel source code for Newman N1 (MT6577) =
===================================================

In order to get kernel compilation working, make sure you follow one of these steps:

- You have 3 folders: kernel, mediatek and toolchain.
  - kernel folder is the basic one, with the linux kernel sources.
  - mediatek folder contains dependences that are necessary to build for MTK platform.
  - toolchain folder contains appropiate cross-compiler.


Option one:
- In Terminal, cd to kernel folder.
  There is a script called build.sh.
  That is the interface you will use to build device kernel.

- Run script with command "./build.sh newmann1" to begin with the build process.
  Once finished, you will find:
  - the new kernel file in root folder ./build_result/kernel/kernel
  - the compiled modules in root folder ./build_result/modules/*.ko

- To perform a clean build run command "./build.sh clean newmann1".


Option two:
- Add toolchain cross-compiler to your path: "export PATH=$PATH:/path_to_your_toolchain/arm-linux-androideabi-4.6/bin/"

- In Terminal, cd to kernel folder.

- Run command "TARGET_PRODUCT=newmann1 MTK_ROOT_CUSTOM=../mediatek/custom/ make"
  Once finished, you will find the new zImage file in your root folder (./kernel/arch/arm/boot/zImage).

- cd to your root folder.

- Patch the new zImage with command "./mediatek/build/tools/mkimage ./kernel/arch/arm/boot/zImage KERNEL > zImagePatched"

- To perform a clean build run commad "TARGET_PRODUCT=newmann1 MTK_ROOT_CUSTOM=../mediatek/custom/ make clean"


Common for both options:
- Get original boot.img for device and unpack it.
- Repack new boot.img using original ramdisk (from stock boot.img) and new generated kernel (kernelFile or zImagePatched).
